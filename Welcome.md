# Welcome to Your Obsidian Starter Vault!

This vault gives you a starting point for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a note-taking app that works with markdown files and helps you connect ideas. Think of this as a launchpad: everything works immediately, but you're meant to make it your own.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Try Daily Notes**: Press `Ctrl` twice, type `daily`, select "Daily notes: Open today's daily note"
2. **Explore Search**: Press `Shift` + `Shift` to search across all your notes
3. **Format Easily**: Type some text, then press `Ctrl` + `S` to auto-format and save
4. **Link Ideas**: Type `[[` to create links between notes, or use `@today` for date links

### Making it Yours

The real power comes when you adapt this to your thinking:
- Some people love daily notes, others prefer project-based organization
- You might prefer tags over folders, or both
- Maybe you'll remove plugins that don't fit your workflow
- Perhaps you'll discover plugins that transform how you work

There's no "right" way - just what works for you.

## Common Questions

**How do I organize my notes?**
Start simple! Use folders for broad topics (Work, Personal, Projects) and links to connect related ideas.

**Can I use this on multiple devices?**
Yes! Store your vault in a cloud service (iCloud, Dropbox, etc.) and sync across devices.

**How do I backup my vault?**
Since it's just text files, any backup method works. Consider using git (like this repository) or cloud storage.
