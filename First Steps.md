# First Steps in Obsidian

You've opened the vault and read the Welcome note. Now what? Here are concrete things to try right now.

## Right Now (2 minutes)

1. **Create a daily note**: Press `Ctrl` twice, type "daily", hit Enter
2. **Write one thing**: One thing you want to do today
3. **Save it**: Press `Ctrl` + `S`

Done? Now keep going.

## Your First Hour

### 1. Create a Daily Note

Press `Ctrl` twice, type "daily", hit Enter. Write a few sentences about what you want to do today.

### 2. Make Your First Link

In your daily note, type `[[` and create a link to something you're thinking about. Click the link when it appears.

### 3. Try Search

Press `Shift` + `Shift` and search for a word you just wrote. Notice how it finds things instantly.

### 4. Format Something

Write some text, then press `Ctrl` + `S`. Watch it clean up the formatting.

## Your First Week

### Experiment with Organization

- Create a folder for a project you're working on
- Make a note about that project
- Link your daily notes to the project note

### Discover Features

- Try the different keyboard shortcuts from the Welcome note
- Explore the Settings menu (don't change anything yet, just look)
- Click around the interface and see what happens

### Build Habits

- Use daily notes for a few days
- Create links when you mention topics
- Use search instead of clicking through folders

### Use Templates

Templates give you a starting structure so you don't start from blank:

1. Press `Ctrl` twice
2. Type "template"
3. Select a template (daily journal, meeting, project, or quick note)

The template fills in automatically. Edit it however you want.

## When You're Ready

Once you've used the vault for a week or two, you might want to:

- **Change the theme** if you don't like the default look
- **Add plugins** for specific needs (check the community plugins)
- **Modify templates** to match your thinking style
- **Adjust settings** to work how you prefer

## Remember

This starter vault is just that - a starter. The goal isn't to use everything exactly as configured. The goal is to discover how you think and organize ideas, then adapt Obsidian to support that.

Some people end up with:
- Minimal plugins and simple folders
- Complex tag systems and daily notes
- Project-based organization with lots of linking
- A mix of everything

All are valid. Start simple, evolve gradually.
