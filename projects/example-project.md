# Garden Project

**Started**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

Redesigning the backyard garden. Focus: things I can actually eat.

Ambitious? Maybe. But tomatoes taste better from your own yard.

## Objectives

- Create raised beds for vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, lettuce)
- Add herb garden near the kitchen window
- Set up drip irrigation system
- Plant fruit trees along the back fence

## Tasks

- [ ] Design garden layout
- [ ] Order materials for raised beds
- [ ] Build 3 raised beds
- [ ] Install drip irrigation
- [ ] Plant seedlings (after last frost)
- [ ] Set up composting area

## Notes

### [[2025-01-15]]

- Measured the backyard: ~400 sq ft
- Going with 3 raised beds, 4x8 feet each
- Need to research drip irrigation (watering cans get old fast)

### [[2025-01-18]]

- Sketched layout. Herb garden in southeast corner for best sun
- Found a solid tutorial on raised bed construction
- Added materials to shopping list. Wallet is ready.

### [[2025-01-20]]

- Ordered cedar lumber and soil
- Tomatoes need 6-8 hours of sun, so I picked the right spot
- Considering a small seating area. For "contemplating" the plants.
